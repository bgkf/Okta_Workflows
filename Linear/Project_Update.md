### Project Updates ###

Two examples of weekly automated updates to projects with a list of associated issues.
<br>
#### First Example <br>
Find all the issues completed in the last week that are associated to a specific project.<br>
<img width="2414" height="728" alt="ITCL Project Update 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f495f263-d85d-44ef-a8c8-58538ec58a64" />
<br>
Formatting the the json to text. The result looks like... <br>
  title: <ISSUE_TITLE><br>
  asignee: <ISSUE_ASSIGNEE><br>
<img width="2421" height="481" alt="ITCL Project Update 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49ff9ffb-afdd-43ab-901a-45b4d50ef1be" />
<br>
Post the update to the project.<br>

<br>
<br>
#### Second Example <br>
Find all the issues completed in the last week that are associated to a specific project.<br>
<img width="2362" height="863" alt="JCL Project Update 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1eac264c-eaf5-4174-a7f3-f852489476b7" />
<br>
Not so much formatting. The result is just a list of issue titles.<br>
<img width="2425" height="607" alt="JCL Project Update 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b9a607e-05e0-4364-a852-dda1cb0b371f" />
